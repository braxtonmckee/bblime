# BBLIME

Welcome to braxblime. It's as close as I can make it to a sublime-style workflow
in the terminal that will work over SSH. What that means, for me, is that

* you can specify a root directory and find all the files you want to edit with ctrl-P
* you can use shift and control with arrow keys and page up/down
* you can use shift-alt or ctrl-D to make multiple selections and edit accordingly
* you have a proper undo buffer
* you can navigate to a line number using ctrl-G
* you can move quickly amongst your open files.

obviously most of the great features of sublime aren't implemented here, but if you
want to edit a bunch of python code in a terminal and want a feel that's reasonably
close to sublime, this should do it.
